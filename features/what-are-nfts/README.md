# Collectibles üÉè

### A bit about Tokens

Collectible are a type of _non-fungible_ token. Non-fungible sounds complicated, but it simply means that each token is unique, and they are not interchangeable on a 1:1 basis. A great example would be Magic the Gathering trading cards: they are all _type_ Magic the Gathering, but each individual card is _unique_ in its' type. 

Collectibles are a way of representing unique things on the blockchain. Sometimes they can represent purely digital items like [_CryptoKitties_](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) or [_BlockCities_](https://www.blockcities.build/) but they can also be used to track real world physical items like bars of gold, or shares in real estate. 

In Ethereum, these collectible tokens are called NFTs \(Non-fungible Token\) and are defined by several token standards, the most popular of which is the [ERC721 Token Standard](http://erc721.org/). 

DappHero lets you build and connect websites to the world of Digital Collectibles, allowing you to build trophy rooms, create new market places, sell goods or just make awesome games!

DappHero's current Collectible integration works on Ethereum Mainnet, and sources data from the awesome open marketplace: [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) so if you're looking for inspiration on how to _create_ a digital collectible that you can then sell and trade for real money, check out their great [developer resources](https://docs.opensea.io/). 

### Read Only

Currently the DappHero integration for Collectibles is _read only_ meaning you can only use it to display information about collectible tokens which already exist on the blockchain, not mint, transfer, burn or otherwise. To create a transaction for a collectible ERC721 contract, you will need to use DappHero to connect directly to the collectible smart contract to access these features. 

### Learn more

To learn more about the underlying technology and standards for ERC721 tokens, DappHero highly recommends looking at the OpenZeppelin documentation for [ERC721 contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc721). Here you will find the technical documentation around the ERC721 standard and the most secure and trusted implementation of the code. You can even learn how to create and deploy your own ERC721 contract from scratch!
