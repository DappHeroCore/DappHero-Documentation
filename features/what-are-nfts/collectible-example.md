# Collectible Example

To help get you started using the Collectible feature of DappHero we have prepared a sample project using Glitch to help you experiment. 

Visit the [Example](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dapphero-nft-example).

In this example we take advantage of multiple collectible features. We start by showing a [list of collectibles](listing-collectables.md) from a particular smart contract and we add Forward and Backwards buttons to [page through Collectibles](listing-collectables.md#pagination-and-limits). Then we create a second page that shows a [single collectible](single-collectibles.md). We link the two pages via the [$THIS](advanced-usdthis.md) keyword and allow dynamic page loading by getting the relevant collectible details from the URL bar with[ $URL](advanced-url-query-params.md).
