{% hint style="warning" %}
When starting with WebFlow from scratch, you will need at least a [Lite Account](https://webflow.com/pricing#site) to add custom script tags. You can always start by cloning our Custom Templates which already have the script tag embedded.

Here is a [bare-bones HTML](https://glitch.com/~dapphero-intro) version of how to add your script tag so you can understand where it needs to be. Regardless of your no-code tool or website builder, the script tag location should be more or less the same.
