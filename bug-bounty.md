{% endhint %}

### Get Started

While we are in Beta, we're creating a Bug Bounty to help us find bugs. We are paying out a token amount of DAI to show our appreciation. It's not a ton, but we do want to show we care!

### $25 USD in DAI

For any bug in the User Interface hosted at DappHero.io. This can be problems with the login, problems with the UI \(functional, not just aestetic\)  or anything in that realm. If something is broken or not working correctly on the website, that will probably count, so let us know!

### $50 USD in DAI

For any bug found in the actual DappHero core engine that runs client-side in users browsers. There are some exceptions that will be at our own discretion: sometimes Web3 and Ethereum can perform in strange ways. 

### Rules

To get a bug bounty you need to do a couple things, first you **must** email the bug information to us at: **dennison@dapphero.io**. Please do not post the bug in the Telegram group or in the forum. We want to have a chance to fix it before we make it public. 

Second, to get the payout, you must confirm for us in your email that you are not a person on the US sanctions list, nor a resident/citizen of any country on the US sanction list.  

Third, we might not list the bugs that are found, but you will have to trust us if we say the bug has already been reported. There might be some bugs for which we decide not to fix right now, we will try to make that list of bugs public, but again, you're going to have to trust us on that one.  

### Terms and Conditions

So, there are some caveats. Bug bounties are at our own discretion. We will try to get back to you within 7 days for a bug report. We may, at any time, limit the total number of bounties we give out. We might stop the program without telling anyone. This is intended to thank our users and beta-testers, so please keep everything civil. Thanks!
